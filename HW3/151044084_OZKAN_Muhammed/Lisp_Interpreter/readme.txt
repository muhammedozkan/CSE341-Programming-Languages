For compile and run:
	-Open Terminal
	-run "clisp gpp_interpreter.lisp"  or "clisp gpp_interpreter.lisp test.g++"  
	-if you want to write output.txt "clisp gpp_interpreter.lisp > output.txt" or 
					"clisp gpp_interpreter.lisp test.g++ > output.txt"


In the 1st selection, the program works as an interpreter. 
"clisp gpp_interpreter.lisp"


In the 2st selection, File will be loaded by the interpreter and interpreted right away. 
"clisp gpp_interpreter.lisp test.g++" 


If you want to terminate the program, you must enter: (exit)

I did this part using regular expressions and syntax rules in accordance with homework pdf and g++ syntax pdf.
