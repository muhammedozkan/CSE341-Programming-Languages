For compile and run:
	-Open Terminal
	-Execute make command
	-run "./a.out"  or "./a.out test.g++"  
	-if you want to write output.txt "./a.out > output.txt" or "./a.out test.g++ > output.txt"
	
In the 1st selection, the program works as an interpreter. 
"./a.out"


In the 2st selection, File will be loaded by the interpreter and interpreted right away. 
"./a.out test.g++"	
	
	
	

If you want to terminate the program, you must enter: (exit)

I did this part using regular expressions and syntax rules in accordance with homework pdf and g++ syntax pdf.
